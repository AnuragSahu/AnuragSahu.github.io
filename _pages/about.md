I am a passionate Software Engineer with 2.5 years of experience in developing cutting-edge technology solutions. My expertise lies in <b>Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Backend Systems using Python</b>. With a strong background in <b>Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science</b>, I thrive on building innovative and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.

I hold a <b>B.Tech in Computer Science and an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from IIIT Hyderabad (Class of 2022)</b>. My academic journey has provided me with a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, vision systems, and software development principles.

At <b>OLA Electric (SDE 2, Computer Vision & Software Development)</b>, I have developed <b>Camera-based Vision Inspection Systems</b> to improve manufacturing quality and efficiency. I have built <b>end-to-end Computer Vision Pipelines</b> for real-time analysis and automation. Additionally, I have worked on <b>robotic automation, stereo camera-based drone tracking, and vision-based inspection systems</b>. Previously, I worked on <b>Pick & Place automation using a robotic arm</b> for dark stores at Ola and developed <b>Python-based MES systems on Ignition</b> for industrial automation.

My technical expertise spans <b>Computer Vision & Machine Learning</b> (OpenCV, YOLOv8, TensorFlow, PyTorch), <b>Software Development</b> (Python, Java (Spring Boot), REST APIs), <b>Robotics & 3D Vision</b> (RealSense D455, ArUco markers, Hand-Eye Calibration), <b>Data Processing & Optimization</b> (Multithreading, Web Scraping optimized to fetch 85 files in 15 minutes), and <b>Cloud & DevOps</b> (Google Cloud, Docker).

Beyond technology, I enjoy <b>motorcycle rides</b> (recently rode to Ghati Subramanya Temple), playing badminton, and exploring different aspects of AI outside work. I also engage in writing technical blogs and mentoring aspiring engineers in computer vision and software development.
