Namaste Everyone! I am Anurag Sahu, Currently working with OLA Electric building high speed and high precision contactless vision inspection systems mostly I own the image processing pipeline starting from building APIs to interact with the Front-End to getting the image, processing those images for multiple camera calibration, point cloud stiching/image sticking for both 3D and 2D proessing based on Deep learning & statical methods to handling the interactions with database and dashboarding.

I interened at Sony Corporation with the <a href='https://www.sonyindiasoftware.co.in/our-business.html'> SARD </a> division where I was involved in improving the 3D reconstruction inherently improving the depth maps and removing motion blur from the images captured from multiple camera systems.

I have recived my Masters by Research and Bachelors in Computer Science from <a href='https://www.iiit.ac.in/'>IIIT Hyderabad</a> working under <a href='https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/'> Prof. K Madhav Krishna </a> with specialization in AI, where I have recieved Dean's distiction list award which awarded to top 5% of the students.
