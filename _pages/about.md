I am a passionate Software Engineer with 2.5 years of experience in developing cutting-edge technology solutions. My expertise lies in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Backend Systems using Python. With a strong background in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, I thrive on building innovative and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from IIIT Hyderabad (Class of 2022). My academic journey has provided me with a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, vision systems, and software development principles.

At OLA Electric (SDE 2, Computer Vision & Software Development), I have developed Camera-based Vision Inspection Systems to improve manufacturing quality and efficiency. I have built end-to-end Computer Vision Pipelines for real-time analysis and automation and have run inference benchmarks on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti using YOLOv8 models and threading. Additionally, I have worked on robotic automation, stereo camera-based drone tracking, and vision-based inspection systems. Previously, I worked on Pick & Place automation using a robotic arm for dark stores at Ola and developed Python-based MES systems on Ignition for industrial automation.

My technical expertise spans Computer Vision & Machine Learning (OpenCV, YOLOv8, TensorFlow, PyTorch), Software Development (Python, Java (Spring Boot), REST APIs), Robotics & 3D Vision (RealSense D455, ArUco markers, Hand-Eye Calibration), Data Processing & Optimization (Multithreading, Web Scraping optimized to fetch 85 files in 15 minutes), and Cloud & DevOps (Google Cloud, Docker).

My projects and research include designing a 3D Printable Mobile Stand (an OBJ model for a stand to hold a phone, earphones, and a watch), building a Drone Tracking System using stereo cameras and computer vision techniques, developing an ArUco-based Calibration Prop for extrinsic camera calibration, and working on an Avatar Creation Pipeline, a LinkedIn blog series on ML-based avatar generation for mobile platforms.

I am actively seeking new opportunities in Dubai as a Computer Vision Engineer or Software Developer, where I can apply my skills in AI, software development, and robotics. I aim to contribute to cutting-edge AI applications in automation, manufacturing, and smart vision systems.

Beyond technology, I enjoy motorcycle rides (recently rode to Ghati Subramanya Temple), playing badminton, and exploring different aspects of AI outside work. I also engage in writing technical blogs and mentoring aspiring engineers in computer vision and software development.
